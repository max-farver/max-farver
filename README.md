## About

I'm a senior at Iowa State University, majoring in Software Engineering with an expected graduation date of December 2021.

Throughout my college career I have participated in Hackathons and worked on side projects with my friends as a way to keep learning outside the classroom. Those great experiences have helped me to solidify the fundamentals that college gave me, and use them to broaden my abilities as a programmer overall.
