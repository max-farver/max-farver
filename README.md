I'm currently looking for a full time position either remote (I will be able to relocate after May of 2020) or near Ames, IA.

## About

I'm a senior at Iowa State University, majoring in Software Engineering and Data Science with an expected graduation date of December 2021. While finishing up my last couple semesters as a part-time student, I plan on working full time.

Throughout my college career I have participated in Hackathons and worked on side projects with my friends as a way to keep learning outside the classroom. Those great experiences have helped me to solidify the fundamentals that college gave me, and use them to broaden my abilities as a programmer overall.
